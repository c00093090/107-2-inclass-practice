## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
x3 <- c("小明","小花")
y3 <- c("小明","小華")
```

!否定意思negation

```{r}
x3 == y3
x3 != y3
```
!放前面與中間同意思

```{r}
!(x3 == y3)
```

x5=想判斷的向量
y5=集合體
%in%屬於
```{r}
x5 <- c("台北市","新北市","高雄市")
y5 <- c("台北市","新北市")

x5 %in% y5
```

```{r}
library(readr)
exData2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/exData2.csv")
currency <- exData2$幣別
```

```{r}
head(currency) #head會顯示物件前六個元素值
```
幾種=factor/class 檢查levels(factor)


資料一進來沒有被當成factor class
```{r}
class(currency)
```

更正為factor class
```{r}
currency <- as.factor(currency)
class(currency)
```

```{r}
levels(currency)
```

length():數向量內的元素個數(向量長度)

```{r}
length(levels(currency))
```

```{r}
step1_extractLevelsVector <- levels(currency)
step1_extractLevelsVector
```

```{r}
step2_countVectorLength <- 
  length(step1_extractLevelsVector)
step2_countVectorLength
```

```{r}
head(currency)
levels(currency)
```

多少日圓
先知道有多少等於日圓(T=1/F=0)
然後相加
```{r}
sum(currency == "日圓JPY/USD")
```
