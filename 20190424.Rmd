## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
m2<-matrix(c("a","b","c","d"),2,2)
class(m2)
typeof(m2)
a<-m2[[1]]
c<-m2[[3]]
bd<-m2[2,]
a
c
bd
```

```{r}
StuList <- list(
  學號=c(172,214,322,425,517),
  姓名=c("小明","大雄","胖虎","小新","大白"),
  成績=c(80,60,90,70,50)
  )
StuList 
StuList[[2]][3]
```
