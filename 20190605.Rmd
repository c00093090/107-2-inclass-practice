## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
utility_cobb_douglass(1,2,0.5,0.8)
```

```{r}
load(url("https://github.com/tpemartin/github-data/blob/master/loopTranscriptData.Rda?raw=true"))
```

```{r}
studentIds <- unique(transcriptDataFinal$學號) # 全部可能學號

# 以前5筆學號為sequence_source
studentIds5 <- studentIds[1:5]

for(i in studentIds5){
  print(i) # 印出studentIds5[[i]]
}
```
